# Amazon Aurora

- cloud db
- different compared to other relational db's
  - scalable, distributed
    - split into zones with data replicated across zones
  - service-oriented architecture AWS's leverages cloud ecosystem
    - Lambda: invoke Lambda events from stored procedures/triggers
    - S3: load data from S3 and store backups/snapshots to S3
    - IAM: use IAM roles to manage db access control
    - Watch: upload systems metrics
  - automated admin tasks
- why RDS
  - automate admin tasks
    - developer does schema design, query contruction and optimization
    - AWS does:
      - automatic fail-over
      - backup, recovery,
      - isolation, security
      - industry compliance
      - scaling
      - patching
      - monitoring
      - maintanence
- compared to Postgres
  - up to 3x performance/throughput
  - better availability and durability
  - reduces cost up to 60%
  - easy migration with no application charge
- performance enhancements
  - read performance
    - read-ahead (when you read something, chance you will read something next to it is high, so it loads it in advance)
    - smart selector
    - read views
  - write performance
    - NUMA aware scheduler
    - latch-free lock manager
  - meta-data access
    - instant schema update
  - availability
    - 6-way replicated storage
    - quorums needed for read and write
- backtracking in the db
  - you can backtrack to a point without requiring restore from backups
  - not destructive
  - good if you're not sure exactly when the db failed
- clone db easily and quickly because the data isn't copied, copy only happens when original and clone volume data differ
- use cases
  - clone a production db to run tests
  - reorganize a db
  - save a point in time snapshot
