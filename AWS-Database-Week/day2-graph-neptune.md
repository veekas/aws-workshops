## graph db applications
- recommendations based on relationships
  - ex. P1 and P2 follow Sport, P1 bought Product, recommend Product to P2
- knowledge graph applications
  - too many relationships
  - e.g. Google can solve 'who painted the mona lisa',
         but not 'what museums should friend Alice visit while in Paris'
         or 'what artists have paintings in the Louvre'
- navigate tax policies
  - Thomson Reuters use Neptune to create links with data for flobal tax solutions

## existing graph db's

- hard to scale
- hard to maintain availability
- expensive

## fully managed graph database
